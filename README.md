# Call-Centre-Trend

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to craft a dashboard that effectively communicates key performance indicators (KPIs) related to call center operations. These KPIs include overall customer satisfaction, calls answered or abandoned, calls categorized by time, speed, average answer speed, and more.

**Data Source:** - Dataset used for this analysis was provided by PWC company.

**Tools Used:** 
- Excel
- Power BI 

**Data Cleaning:**
The dataset was meticulously cleaned by handling missing values, removing duplicates, renaming columns for better clarity, and standardizing data formats to ensure uniformity across all records.

**Data Analysis:**
The data was analyzed using DAX formulas to create measures that accurately capture the essential KPIs.

**Key Insights:**
- **Call Volume:** The total call volume was 5,000 calls.
- **Abandoned Calls:** Out of the total, 946 calls were abandoned, indicating a potential area for improvement in customer wait times and service efficiency.
- **Answered Calls:** 4,054 calls were answered, reflecting the call center's capacity to manage a high volume of incoming calls.
- **Resolved Calls:** Of the answered calls, 3,646 were resolved, showcasing a strong problem-solving capability within the team.
- **Unresolved Calls:** 1,354 calls remained unresolved, highlighting a need for further analysis to understand the reasons and develop strategies to improve resolution rates.
- **Average Pickup Speed:** The average pickup speed was 67.52 seconds, indicating that while the response time is reasonable, there may be room for optimization to enhance customer experience.
- **Average Call Duration:** The average call duration increased notably during the peak period from 11am to 1PM, likely due to higher call volumes and more complex issues being addressed. Despite this, the majority of incoming calls were related to streaming topics, with technical support and other issues following, indicating that the nature of the calls also contributed to longer handling times.

**Agent Performance:**
- **Staffing:** The call center was staffed by 8 agents.
- **Calls per Agent:** With a total of 5,000 calls, each agent handled approximately 625 calls. This workload distribution suggests a high level of activity for each agent, emphasizing the importance of monitoring agent fatigue and performance to maintain quality service.

**Customer Satisfaction:**
- **Average Satisfaction Rating:** The average customer satisfaction rating was 3.40 out of 5, which suggests that while customers are generally satisfied, there is room for improvement in delivering a more exceptional service experience.

**Recommendations:**
1. **Reduce Abandoned Calls:** Implement strategies to reduce call abandonment, such as optimizing call routing, increasing staff during busy periods, or providing customers with estimated wait times.
2. **Improve Call Resolution:** Focus on training and resources that enable agents to resolve more calls on the first contact, thereby reducing the number of unresolved calls.
3. **Enhance Agent Support:** Monitor agent workload and provide additional support or breaks to prevent burnout, ensuring that service quality remains high.
4. **Increase Customer Satisfaction:** Gather and analyze customer feedback to identify specific areas for improvement and implement targeted initiatives to boost satisfaction ratings.

Conclusion:
The analysis reveals that the call center is managing a significant volume of calls with a relatively high resolution rate. However, the number of abandoned and unresolved calls, along with a moderate customer satisfaction rating, indicates areas where service delivery could be enhanced. The average pickup speed is reasonable, but optimizing it further could positively impact customer experience.
